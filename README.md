# ai-agent

In this project I will be leveraging my knowledge of Python and the functional programming paradigm to implement a command line AI Agent. 

I hope to learn how AI works under the hood of popular agentic code editors and how to use the Gemini API to make something similar.

## What does the agent do?
- Will be able to accept a coding task 
- Choose from a set of pre-defined functions to work on the task 
- And repeats that function until the task is complete
